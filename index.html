            <p>Team Fortress 2, also known as TF2, is a first-person team-based shooter game. First released to the public in October 2007. The game is based around a game play loop predominantly based around variations of capture the flag or king of the hill game modes. But that is not what has allowed the game to stick around for going on for almost 2 decades. What has allowed it to stick around and maintain a sizable player base is the fact that this janky pile of spaghetti code is a game held together by a community and a phenomenal gameplay loop. With ease of aces and a massive skill ceiling with a recognizable art style and iconic characters that are the origin and basis of an entire section of meme culture. Down below are three videos discussing the greatness of TF2 beater than I can do by myself.</p>
